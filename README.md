Jungle Cook Recipe site-
  Jungle Cook is a place to store recipes that you've made in the past or want to try later. Make an account and post a recipe or browse at others'. The site lets you customize the ingredients, intructions, serving size and more. Be as specific as you like and go in full detail over every step!
  Utilizing html, css, json, jquery, firebase and sweetalerts to bring the site alive ensures a unique experience for everyone. Use the navigation bar to get from page to page. Browse has premade recipes in there for you! Login to use the create feature and view all of your creations when you're done. Create takes all of your inserted data, stores them into variables and then spits them out into a nice recipe card. Each recipe card has a view page to get further instuctions and ingredient details. 
Bugs:

-logout is somewhat buggy and not always functional.
-recipe view does not show details of the respective recipe.

-the footer tends to stick to the bottom of the page.
