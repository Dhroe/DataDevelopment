<p>Hello,</p><br\>
<P>I'm a graduate at IUPUI specializing in game design. I plan on getting my master's degree and graduating in 2021. I'm familiar with both Unreal engine and Unity, but prefer Unreal.</P><br\>
<p>I focus on level and mechanic design as well as 3D modeling. I also work with javascript, PHP, C#, databases and Unreal's visual blueprints.</p><br\>
